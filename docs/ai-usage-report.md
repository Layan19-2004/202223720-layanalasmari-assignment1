## How AI Was Used

ChatGPT was used as a learning assistant throughout the development process. It helped to:

- Clarify HTML structure and best practices.
- Improve grammar and professionalism in the "About Me" section.
- Explain responsive design concepts such as the viewport meta tag and media queries.
- Suggest font combinations and design refinements.
- Review and improve CSS organization and structure.
- Assisted in understanding and implementing JavaScript features such as smooth scrolling and dynamic greeting messages.
- Assist in structuring the README and technical documentation clearly.

The core ideas, design choices, and project direction were generated independently. AI was primarily used to refine, polish, and validate implementation decisions.
